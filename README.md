The plugin for adding Gods to minecraft!

A God is an entity that exist because a player has chosen to believe in it.

A player shows his faith in a god by building an altar for his god and using the altar to pray. 
In this way, many gods may exist at a time, all with names created by the players.

The main purpose for believing in these Gods is to gain from the help the Gods provide (see below) and to provide some basic faction play based on ideology and culture (I.e. "My god is better than yours because apples are holy!").

Another purpose is simply to get people inspired to build awesome churches and use them for their Gods.

With Holy Lands, players can easily protect their lands from grief by simply building alters to their Gods.
